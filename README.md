# UiKeyboardDismiss
Example code for dismissing an iOS keyboard by tapping off of it (in Swift)


It’s become pretty standard for the iOS keyboard to be dismissed when you tap anywhere off of the keyboard. Unfortunately, this behaviour isn’t standard so you get to implement it yourself.

See details of implementation at http://cmoulton.com/blog/dismissing-ios-keyboard-user-taps/
